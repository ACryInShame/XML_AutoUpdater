# XML_AutoUpdater
This program replaces the matching nodes in UpdateElements.xml in-between the <update> nodes, with matching nodes in any files in the Data folder (including subfolders)


Go to the Bin > debug folders
Update the UpdateElements.xml to what you wish to replace.
put the files you wish to update into the Data folder
run XML_AutoUpdater.exe

when it says finished, just press any button to exit.

Check your files as they should be done.

Note: some anti-virus software may block it because it is a .exe file. All the files are there for you to check to make sure it's all clean.
