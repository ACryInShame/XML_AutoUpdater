# XML_AutoUpdater
This program replaces all data inbetween the nodes in any files in the Data folder (including subfolders) with info matching nodes from the UpdateElements.xml.


Go to the Bin > debug folders and Update the UpdateElements.xml to what you wish to replace.
put the files you wish to update into the Data folder and run XML_AutoUpdater.exe. When it says finished, just press any button to exit.

Check your files as they should be done.

Note: some anti-virus software may block it because it is a .exe file. All the files are there for you to check to make sure it's all clean.
